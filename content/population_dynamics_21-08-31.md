## Some terms/definitions from PhD Thesis by Esteban Guevara Hidalgo

- Algorithms that do population control in a rare event setting are called **cloning algorithms**.
- Two variants: **non-constant** and **constant total population**: In his opinion the first is advantageous:
  - uniform **pruning**/**cloning** induces correlations into the dynamics
  - when populations are very fluctuating, finite-population effects cause problems (risk of population being wiped out by single clone)

### Large deviations
> The mathematical theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of the probability of extreme events while the number of observations grows.[^mehl_2008]



## papers found (starting point was PhD thesis of Hidalgo, but then also through others)


### from Lu, Lu & Nolen
The Lu, Lu & Nolen paper doesn't seem to have much good literature:
 - 3 papers on Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)

### from Hidalgo's PhD thesis
- Papers that do probabilistic annihilation on collision, i.e. particles will either scatter elastically or be annihilated:
  - Hidalgo mentions [^visco_2008] as example for a constant population implementation on p. xxii, but I must have misunderstood that
    Upon collision the two particles are removed from the system with fixed probability p and do collision with 1-p
  - In this paper they mention [^coppex_2004] as major inspiration, but that is also about ballistic annihilation and no cloning
- [^mehl_2008]



### misc
- [^sherman_1986] paper that does things surprisingly close to what we do: "create and destroy" some "elements" with certain probability (depending on the time step) at every time step and do a random walk in between. Does not keep the total population constant! (from Burkhard)
