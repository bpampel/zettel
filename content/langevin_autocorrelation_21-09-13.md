Starting point: Calculated VACF for the general Langevin dynamics with birth-death: Why is it overshooting?

Burkhard explained (and it is reasonable): assuming a harmonic well it can be seen as basically the motion of damped oscillator --> behavior is expected. Overdamped case does not overshoot!

See also Schwabl - Statistische Mechanik p. 420, that might be a quick derivation
