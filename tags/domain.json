That also has the benefit of using automatic deployment via github actions. So the goal is to serve the website under bpampel.github.io but let it also be accessible via bpampel.de.\nTo get the redirect working, you need to do two steps:\nset the correct A records for your domain tell github the domain it should serve the content for Generally, changes to DNS records might take a while to have effect, so be patient.\nSetting A records To set the A records, you need to access the DNS settings of your domain (often a web interface). Then, you need to add the four A records given on this website\nIn my case, I had no A records set previously. It might be a bit more complicated if you want to redirect only some subdomain.\nI also set a CNAME record for www.bpampel.de to bpampel.github.io.\nGithub settings On github.com, go to the repository hosting the website and access the Settings. Under Pages you can set a custom domain, simply enter it here and click save (in my case bpampel.de).\nIt will take a bit until github has checked that your domain indeed links to github pages and it will then generate a SSL certificate, so your website can be served securely via HTTPS. This might take a bit.\nDue to caching, the changes might not be live directly. But after some time you should hopefully have a working redirect.\n"
