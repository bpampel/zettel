Because I generated most of the bib entries automatically with zotero, often both ISBN/ISSN and DOI are set. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lengthen the bibliography entries by including both, but by default you can only remove the identifiers unconditionally. adding a citenum command A simple implementation of the \\citenum command is found in this StackExchange answer:\n\\DeclareCiteCommand{\\citenum}% {\\usebibmacro{cite:init}% \\usebibmacro{prenote}} {\\usebibmacro{citeindex}% \\usebibmacro{cite:comp}} {} {\\usebibmacro{cite:dump}% \\usebibmacro{postnote}} Removing the \u0026ldquo;In :\u0026rdquo; prefix for papers under preparation The numeric biblatex style for @article entries looks like this (simplified):\nFirst1 Last1, First2 Last2, and First3 Last3. “Title of paper.” In: Journal title vol.issue (year)\nI had some papers that were under preparation at the time of finishing the thesis that I wanted to include nevertheless. Using a @article entry without journal information and date = {under preparation} does not work out of the box: the prefix In: is added even if no journal title is set.\nTo remove it, the in: command is modified:\n\\renewbibmacro*{in:}{ \\iffieldundef{journaltitle} {} {\\bibstring{in}\\printunit{\\intitlepunct}} } Show ISBN/ISSN only if DOI is not set \\AtEveryBibitem{ \\iffieldundef{doi} {} {\\clearfield{issn}% \\clearfield{isbn}}% } "
