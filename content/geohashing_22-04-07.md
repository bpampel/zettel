Idea: tool that presents the air-line distance, walking time, biking time (etc) to todays hash.

Use the [geohashing.py](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/geohashing/blob/master/geohashing.py) to get the coordinates of the hash 


### Air-line distance
Distance between two coordinates: *Lambert's formula*  
See e.g. [this website](https://www.calculator.net/distance-calculator.html)

See also [this tool](http://tjum.anthill.de/cgi-bin/geohash.cgi?lat=49.6498&lon=11.1381&nr=1&t=&date=&unit=km) that calculates the distance between the hash and user-specified coordinates


### walking / biking
Use e.g. [brouter](http://brouter.de/brouter-web) to calculate the time. Problem: there is no API?
